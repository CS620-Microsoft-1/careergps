```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open http://localhost:3000.

## Scripts

| Command | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `npm run dev` | Start the dev server |
| `npm run build` | Production build (also type-checks) |
| `npm run lint` | Run ESLint |
| `npm run typecheck` | Generate route types and run the TypeScript compiler |

## Structure

```text
app/                 routes, layouts, global styles
components/ui/       shadcn/ui primitives (owned source, restyle freely)
components/layout/   app shell: sidebar, topbar, mobile nav, user menu, page header
components/auth/     login, signup, onboarding pieces
components/panels/   side panels (Copilot, sources, explanations)
components/common/   shared building blocks (logo, form fields, empty states)
lib/                 nav items, form options, validation schemas, utilities
types/               shared TypeScript types
```

Add more shadcn components with `npx shadcn@latest add <name>`.

## Responsive rules

Every screen must work from a 320px phone to a 2560px monitor, and must respect the
browser's font-size setting. Follow these rules when building pages:

1. **Sizes in rem, not px.** Use Tailwind's scale (`h-10.5`, `max-w-100`) and the type
   tokens in `app/globals.css` (`text-control`, `text-title`, `text-page-title`,
   `text-display`). Raw `px` is only for borders, rings and hairlines.
2. **Mobile first.** Write the phone layout unprefixed, then add `sm:` (640px), `md:` (768px),
   `lg:` (1024px), `xl:` (1280px). Breakpoints are rem-based, so they also follow browser zoom.
3. **Center bounded content.** Page content uses `mx-auto w-full max-w-290` so wide
   screens stay balanced instead of hugging the left edge.
4. **Use `dvh`, not `vh`, for full-height layouts** (`min-h-dvh`), so mobile browser
   toolbars don't cut content off. Tall content scrolls inside its own column on short screens.
5. **Grids and flex shrink safely.** Use `grid-cols-[minmax(0,1fr)…]` / `min-w-0` on flex
   children, and let rows wrap. Only tables and code blocks may scroll sideways, inside
   their own `overflow-x-auto` wrapper.
6. **Respect notches.** Fixed elements near screen edges (e.g. the Ask CareerGPS button) add
   `env(safe-area-inset-*)` to their offset.
7. **Touch targets** are at least 36px (buttons) / 42px (inputs) tall.

Check each new screen at 320, 390, 768, 1024, 1366×650 (short laptop), 1920 and 2560 wide,
plus with the browser's default font size raised to 20px. No page may scroll horizontally.
